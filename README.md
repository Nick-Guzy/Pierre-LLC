2. Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "ToDoList". 
3. Run `dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher.
4. Open the browser to _https://localhost:5001_. If you cannot access localhost:5001 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS. To learn about this, review this lesson: [Redirecting to HTTPS and Issuing a Security Certificate](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/basic-web-applications/redirecting-to-https-and-issuing-a-security-certificate).
